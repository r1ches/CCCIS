CCCIS Problems

I created and exported the files from Eclipse as an IDE.

Problem 1 still has a strange issue when returning a proper value for a single level linked list (although if that is the case, why is someone running it to be merged to itself?). It does work for the multiple level and null lists i have tried.

Problem 2 handles things well for all my tests, also, if you delete the commenting on line 6 it will print the password before the required change number.



Included are three "ProjRunner files" which I used to do simple evaluations of the two problems. The first Projrunner is for building and running some linked lists for the first problem. The second and third Projrunner are for the second problem, the third is saved to output things from the AscII list because I wanted to test more than the "regular keyboard". These second and third files are not terribly extensive, though, just some base cases.
